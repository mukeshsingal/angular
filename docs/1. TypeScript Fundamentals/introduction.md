### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is the superset of Javascript. It means all javascript code is valid in typescript. But typescript has few more features which are not available in current version of Javascript. 

- Optional Strong Typing
- Object-oriented features
- Catch most errors at compile time instead of runtime.


Current browsers don't understand typescript. So we need to transpile typescript code to javascript code, so the browser can understand.
