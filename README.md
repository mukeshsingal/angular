# angular

A framework for building client applications in HTML, CSS and Javascript/Typescript.

### Why Angular, cannot we use plain JS?

Well, we certainly can, but as our application gets bigger, Javascript and JQuery become hard to maintain. Also, the application built on JQuery or JS becomes hard to test.

### Benefits of using Angular 
- Gives our application a clean structure which is easy to understand and maintain. 
- Includes a lot of reusable code
- Make our application more testable.

_Just to Summerize, not we don't need angular to make the web application, but using Angular make life lot easier._
